Rules are the core of Verdex detection.

## Definition

Rules are auto-discovered in `templates/<product>/rules/` directories and are using `.yml` extension.

The syntax is deliberately close to that of the [Nuclei templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei), to simplify the development of new rules.

The default structure of a rule is the following:

```yaml
# General information
info:
  product: keycloak    # Associated product
  author: pierreavn   # Variable author

# Matching versions
# available syntax: https://github.com/Masterminds/semver
version: '>= 25.0.1'

# Checks
http:
  - method: GET         # HTTP method
    path: '/info'       # Path on target

    match-condition: and
    matchers:
      - type: word              # Resolve method ('status', 'word' or 'regex')
        part: body              # Part where to extract value ('body' only)
        word: '{"key": "newTranslationKey"'

      - type: status
        status: 200
```
