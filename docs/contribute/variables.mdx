Variables are useful to extract specific information from service, to be used in rules.

## Definition

Variables are auto-discovered in `templates/<product>/variables/` directories and are using `.yml` extension.

The default structure of a variable is the following:

```yaml
# General information
info:
  product: keycloak    # Associated product
  author: pierreavn   # Variable author

# How to resolve variable value
resolve:
  type: regex                  # Resolve method ('regex' only)
  method: GET                  # HTTP method
  path: '/info'                # Path on target
  part: body                   # Part where to extract value ('body' only)
  regex: '"name": "(a-z)+"'    # Matching regex
  group: 1                     # Matching regex group number
```

## Usage

Variables can be used with `{{variableFileName}}` in `path` of rules or other variables.

For example in the following rule, variable `resourcesId.yml` will be replaced in path:

```yaml
info:
  product: keycloak
  author: pierreavn

version: '>= 25.0.1, < 26.0.7'

http:
  - method: GET
    path: '/resources/{{resourcesId}}/login/resources/js/authChecker.js'

    match-condition: and
    matchers:
      - type: word
        part: body
        word: '// Remove the timeout'

      - type: status
        status: 200
```
