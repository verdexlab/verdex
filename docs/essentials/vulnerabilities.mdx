We are aware of the difficulty of obtaining a precise list of vulnerabilities actually applicable to a specific version.

The main objective behind Verdex is to **quickly identify the vulnerabilities associated with the detected version**.

The list of vulnerabilities is **automatically displayed at the end of a successful scan**, as well as **in the output files**.

<Note>
    To provide accurate vulnerabilities, Verdex relies on search-vulns.com CVE data and first.org EPSS data.

More CVE data are available in output files (see below).


## Available CVE data

Here are CVE data available in Verdex output files:
- **CVE ID** (`CVE-YYYY-XXXX`)
- **Description**
- **CVSS score** preferably v3.1 if available
- **EPSS score** from [first.org API](https://www.first.org/epss/api)
- **Vulnerable versions**
- **Is it a Known Exploited Vulnerability (KEV)**
- **Publication date**

Here is data example for `CVE-2022-4361` on Keycloak:
```json
{
    "id": "CVE-2022-4361",
    "description": "Keycloak, an open-source identity and access management solution, has a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the SAML or OIDC providers. The vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts by setting the AssertionConsumerServiceURL value or the redirect_uri.",
    "cvss_score": 10,
    "epss_score": 0.00311,
    "is_kev": false,
    "vulnerable_versions": [
        "21.0.2"
    ],
    "published_at": "2023-07-07"
},
```
