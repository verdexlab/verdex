Welcome to **Verdex**, a fast, collaborative, and open-source tool designed to 
**detect online service versions through feature-based analysis**,
even when traditional versioning information is unavailable.

One of the biggest challenges in defensive cybersecurity is identifying vulnerabilities in exposed services, 
which requires accurately determining the service version.

Instead of relying on exposed headers, Verdex quickly analyzes the features present on a service. 
For example, **if a feature was introduced in a specific version, Verdex uses this information to deduce the 
minimum version of the service** (see [How It Works](/how-it-works) for more information).

<Note>
  ðŸª¶ Verdex relies solely on **non-aggressive methods**, in particular by using mostly static assets (javascript, css and html files).
</Note>

Currently, Verdex supports detecting versions of **Keycloak** and **NextCloud** (see [Products](/essentials/products)).

<Warning>
  Any unauthorized use of Verdex to analyze or exploit online services is strictly prohibited and violates both our license agreement and applicable laws. 
  **Verdex must be used with explicit authorization from the owner or administrator of the targets being scanned**.
