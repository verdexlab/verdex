<Icon icon="tornado" iconType="duotone" /> **Expert** mode unlocks advanced Verdex features, such as:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<Icon icon="light-emergency-on" iconType="duotone" />&nbsp;&nbsp;
[List vulnerabilities](/expert/vulnerabilities) and update recommendations associated with detected versions

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<Icon icon="sparkles" iconType="duotone" />&nbsp;&nbsp;
_More to come..._

These features are not publicly available for two main reasons:
1. With reliable data, their use for malicious purposes greatly increases the potential for attacks on unauthorized targets
2. They require a considerable amount of human time to maintain in order to provide the most accurate data possible
